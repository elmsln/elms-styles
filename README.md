This is the github home for the library published at http://elms-styles.jayperryworks.com/ .  The only difference is that github can't host one of the library PSDs which is over 100 megs cause of images / screens.  To get that file, please 
download the package from http://elms-styles.jayperryworks.com/ .  For everything else, you can get derivatives of the 1.x version here. Enjoy!

Icons & Fonts
We love icons. Many of the navigational components in this style library rely on icons, which unfortunately we could not include in this release due to licensing requirements (we are not authorized to redistribute them). They have been replaced in the PSD files with “placeholders” (a circle labeled ICON). You’ll need to swap these out with your own icons.

We highly recommend Iconmonstr, a huge library of beautifully- drawn, free-to-use icons.

The fonts we used are from Google’s excellent (and free) library:

Display:  Bitter Body:  Open Sans
Download and install before you open the PSD.
